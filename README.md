The Machobane Farming System (MFS)—Mantsa Tlala, or “expeller of hunger” in Sesotho—was
developed in the 1950s by Dr. Joseph J. Machobane. His sustainable agricultural system was inspired by more than a decade
of research on traditional Basotho farming techniques. Early research revealed that MFS out-yielded conventional cropping
methods nearly three-fold.4 An intensive, low-input, intercropped farming system; MFS eschews dependency on expensive
external inputs. By shifting away from grain monocultures and encouraging ecological intensification of cultivation on small
plots, it provides a year-round supply of food.

WE AS Hohobe group we created a simulator  of this Machobane System using Assembler Programming language
